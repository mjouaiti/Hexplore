# Hexplore


This Hexplore robot is based on MiniRHex which a miniature scale hexapod designed by the [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/) inspired by the design of RHex.


We adapted their model with an arrticulated body to allow for more flexibility, especially with obstacles.
